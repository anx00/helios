# Legacy Docs

This folder contains superseded, duplicated, or legacy docs that still have
some historical/context value.

They are not the primary reference for current implementation.

Typical reasons a doc is archived:
- superseded by a more detailed canonical doc
- overlapping "project overview" versions
- temporary checklist or proposal no longer used as source of truth
- user-facing explainer duplicated by a technical guide

If you need current behavior, start from:
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/system/`
- `docs/weather/`
- `docs/market/`
- `docs/trading/`
